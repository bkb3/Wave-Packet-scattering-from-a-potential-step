# Wave-Packet-scattering-from-a-potential-step
This is another common problem in quantum mechanics which involves scattering of gaussian wave packet from a potential step.
We assume the initial incident packet to be gaussian. The problem is to find out the probability of the reflected and transmitted 
waves as well as reflection and transmission coeffecients. The approach is pretty straight forward.
