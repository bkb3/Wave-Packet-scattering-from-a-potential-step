(*This is our wave which will move towards the origin from -Infinity and strikes the potential step at x=0*)

(*Unfortunately I have to assume a[k] to be 1 for faster computation
in my machine, the resultant plots will simply be a path of that
gaussian packet which thus will be a straight line. If your 
computer is powerful, you can try uncommenting relevant terms above 
and below and edit similarly wherever possible. PR are welcome!*)
